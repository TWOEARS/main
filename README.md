Two!Ears Auditory Model
=======================

**A computational framework for modelling active exploratory listening that assigns meaning to auditory scenes**

The Two!Ears auditory model consists of several stages for modeling active human
listening. These stages include not only classical signal driven processing
steps like you can find in the [Auditory Modeling
Toolbox](http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net/). It comes also with a complete acoustical
simulation framework for creating binaural ear signals for specified acoustical
scenes. The classical auditory signal processing is further accompanied by a black
board architecture that allows top-down processing and the inclusion of world
knowledge to the model.

For an introduction to the model, see http://twoears.aipa.tu-berlin.de/doc
